# People-s-Daily-Data-Collection
# This repository is for the data collection project of People's Daily, which is one of the biggest news media in mainland China. 
# We are now trying to finish coding the scrapper so that everyone can easily scrape whatever they need for ther own research. 
# We encourage others to use our scrappers, but please do not forget to credit to us.
# The current scrapper file is written with R, and it is based on a version that Professor Kouhei Watanabe wrote for a workshop in Koube. The original file is availble at https://github.com/koheiw/workshop-Kobe/blob/master/scraper.R .
